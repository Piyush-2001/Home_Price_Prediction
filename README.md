# Home_Price_Prediction
End-to-End Machine Learning Regression Project: Housing Price Prediction
This project is an end-to-end machine learning regression project that predicts housing prices based on various features such as the number of bedrooms, location, and square footage. The project is built using Python and Flask and is hosted on a cloud platform for easy accessibility.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the Bengaluru Housing Dataset, which is a widely used dataset in the field of machine learning. The dataset contains 13320 samples and 9 features.

Project Structure
The project is structured as follows:

data: This folder contains the data used in the project.

models: This folder contains the trained machine learning model.

client: This folder contains the HTML templates used in the Flask web application.

server.py: This is the main Flask application file.

requirements.txt: This file contains the Python packages required to run the project.

Machine Learning Model
The machine learning model used in this project is the Linear Regressor. The model was trained using the Scikit-learn library and was selected based on its high accuracy.

Web Application
The web application was built using Flask and allows users to input various features of a house and get a predicted price in return. The application is hosted on a cloud platform for easy accessibility.
